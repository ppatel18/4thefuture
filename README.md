Project for Chimehack 4

## The problem
 Refugee children are unable to access formal schooling and quality education while they are on the move.

## Our solution
A web app that targets refugee students from ages 5 to 14 with catered lesson plans using material and videos from Coursera. Students and teachers will login and vertified through Facebook. To make sure students actually understand fundamental concepts AI with IBM Watson will analyze if answers include certain keywords and generate data and charts for teachers. Teachers can then fine tune their teaching material and make ajustments if students don't understand a concept. In addition if a student moves to a different area, a new teacher can still access the student's current progress to continue the curriculum. There are options to include VR in the course material. 

We understand that our tech solution will have risks with connectively but we can migrate some of the risks by applying our service to Facebook Free Basics so that more refugees can have access.

## Features
* Student's school progress will be saved even when on the move with no stable residence.
* IBM Watson will analyze group and individual student trends to make sure the lesson plan is catered correctly.
* Standarized primary education and more customized career education materials through Coursera.
* Enjoyable activity for students using VR and speech recognition.
* Google translate to cover major refugee languages.

## Future iterations
Partner with established non profit organizations to organize food, clothing, toys, etc to students who achieve milestones in their curriculum and be able to be featured on a community portal. If prizes can be promoted to a community level then parents can also get involved. The community portal can then be transformed to include story sharing and a hiring platform.
