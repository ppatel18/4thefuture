Project for Chimehack 4

## The problem
 Refugee children are unable to access formal schooling and quality education while they are on the move.

## Our solution
A web app that targets refugee students from ages 5 to 14 with catered lesson plans using material and videos from Coursera. Students and teachers will login and vertified through Facebook. To make sure students actually understand fundamental concepts AI with IBM Watson will analyze if answers include certain keywords and generate data and charts for teachers. Teachers can then fine tune their teaching material and make ajustments if students don't understand a concept. In addition if a student moves to a different area, a new teacher can still access the student's current progress to continue the curriculum.  

We understand that our tech solution will have risks with connectively but we can migrate some of the risks by applying our service to Facebook Free Basics so that more refugees can have access.
